The Task given was: The Pizza Task

1. Description

Let’s say you want to start a new pizza delivery business. Please create a web application for ordering pizza for your clients, which contains a shopping cart. Take the pizza order and the delivery address and contact details for the client. Login is not required but could be available for checking the history of orders.

2. Requirements

• Your clients should be able to order pizzas from the menu

• The menu contains at least 8 pizzas

• You can decide what else you want in the menu

• Processing order/etc. with payment is NOT required. Concentrate on the interface to your pizza customer up to the point the customer confirms his order.

• The pizza order process should cover ordering single or several pizzas with definition of the quantity and calculation of a total price in Euros and US$ also adding delivery costs to the bill.

3. Technology (preferred, as innoscripta uses them for their projects)

• Frontend – ReactJS

• Backend – Laravel

• Database – MySQL

• You get extra points for adding testing (for both frontend and backend);

• Design - you are free to use any framework or library whatever you want but keep in mind innoscripta primarly judges functionality and workflow. Less is more.
